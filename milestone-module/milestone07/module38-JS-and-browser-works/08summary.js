    03. What is a CDN? | How do CDNs work?
        ==> A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers 
            which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.
        ==> A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet content 
            including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.

    04. V8 Engine
    05. Browser Render Tree
    06. JavaScript is a single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous, concurrent programming language with lots of flexibility.
    07. Event Loop

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    # JavaScript execute V8 engine --> Interpret + Just in time Compilation (JIT Compiler)
    # JavaScript work sequentially and use Event Loop to handle which is Non-Blocking and Asynchronous
    # Event Loop contain Stack, Queue, Heap and CallBack
    # Understanding JavaScript â€” Heap, Stack, Event-loops and Callback Queue
      (Link: https://javascript.plainenglish.io/understanding-javascript-heap-stack-event-loops-and-callback-queue-6fdec3cfe32e)
    # Handling I/O is typically performed via events and callbacks
    # Call Stack - A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter to keep track of its place in a script. 
      (Link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Call_stack)
    # Heap - Objects are allocated in a heap which is just a name to denote a large (mostly unstructured) region of memory.

    01. How Does Internet Works? Link: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3c1ih2NJEg)
    02. Render Tree = DOM Tree + CSSOM Tree 
        (Render --> To show or display)
        DOM Tree + Style Structures --> Render Tree --> Paint
    03. V8 Engine ==> Interpret + JIT Comiler + TurboFan (Optimization) + Garbage Collection
    04. Synchronouns Vs Asynchronouns
    05. setTimeout, setInterval, clearInterval, fetch, async await
        Synchronous:
            console.log, normal function
        Asynchronous: 
            setTimeout, SetInterval, fetch, async await
            # async await --> looks Synchronous but works Asynchronously
    06. JavaScript Event Loop and Concurrency
