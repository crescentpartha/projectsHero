// 24.1 Module Introduction and what is JavaScript

// Q1: What is JavaScript?
/* 
JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. 
It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. 
It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. 
It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

// Javascript is a client-site application to create web appliction and it is single threated, high-level  interpreted programming language.

// Q2: What is Programming Language?
// Programming languages are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.

// Q3: What is Computer Language?
// A computer language is a formal language used in communication with a computer.

/* 
// Q4: What is the difference between a machine language vs high-level language?
Machine Language / Assembly Languages / Low-level Languages:
    01. A low-level languages are machine-oriented, hardware specific and not portable.
    02. Machine code is to be read/executed by the computer

High-level Languages:
    01. High level code is Portable code can run on multiple computer systems without modification.
    02. A high-level language is user-oriented
*/

// Both machine code and assembly languages are hardware specific and not portable. This means that the machine code used to run a program on one specific computer needs to be modified to run on another computer. Portable code in a high-level language can run on multiple computer systems without modification.
// High-level code is designed to be read by human programmers. Machine code is to be read/executed by the computer High level code can be portable/translated for different machines Machine code is specific to a particular machine.
// A high-level language is one that is user-oriented. A low-level language is machine-oriented.

/* 
// Q5: Compiled Language vs Interpreted Language?
Compiled Language:
    01. A compiled language is a programming language whose implementations are typically compilers and not interpreters.
    02. Once the program is compiled it is expressed in the instructions of the target machine.
    03. There are at least two steps to get from source code to execution.
    04. Compiled programs run faster than interpreted programs.
    05. Compilation errors prevent the code from compiling.
    06. The code of compiled language can be executed directly by the computer’s CPU.
    07. This language delivers better performance.
    08. Example of compiled language – C, C++, C#, CLEO, COBOL, etc.

Interpreted Language:
    01. An interpreted language is a programming language whose implementations execute instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions.
    02. The instructions are not directly executed by the target machine.
    03. There is only one step to get from source code to execution.
    04. Interpreted programs can be modified while the program is running.
    05. All the debugging occurs at run-time.
    06. A program written in an interpreted language is not compiled, it is interpreted.
    07. This languages delivers relatively slower performance.
    08. Example of Interpreted language – JavaScript, Perl, Python, Java, BASIC, etc.
